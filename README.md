The app is working with data from the opendota api. I created the class to get up to date data from the api, but since the free version is a bit wonky, I
downloaded manually a test sample json from the api and created another class to get data from the downloaded local json files. 
If you want to use the dota Api just change the import to the DotaApi instead of DotaJson, and I recommend adding api key to the functions inside the DotaApi. 

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
